# HaleCoin

Your Daily Token Exercise.

# Installation

1. `git clone` the repo and `cd` into it
1. Install and build [OpenPose (demo)](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose/blob/master/doc/demo_overview.md)
1. `npm i`
1. `cd halecoin-client`
1. `npm i`
1. `cd ..`

# Running

We need to start 3 things: Parsing server, OpenPose, and client.
1. Start parsing server: `npm start`
1. Start OpenPose and output .json files into folder: `(something)`
1. Start client: `cd halecoin-client` and then `npm start`

Go to `localhost:3000` on a browser.

# Usage

Do a push-up within the video (side-on works best). You should see your earned HaleCoins go up, and DJ Khaled should tell you to do "another one".
