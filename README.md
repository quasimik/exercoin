# HaleCoin

Your Daily Token Exercise.

> hale : free from defect, disease, or infirmity; also, retaining exceptional health and vigor - "a hale and hearty old man"
[Merriam Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hale)

Imagine being paid for every pushup you do. That's not just in your imagination anymore. Welcome to HaleCoin.

Our project includes a proof-of-concept demo which detects pushups from webcam input taken from the side.

Intended to motivate people to exercise more, users can not only mine individually, but mine as a group. 
Users can set up pools where they can compete with each other to do the most exercise in a set period, and the winner gets all the mined coins. 
This presents a new paradigm for social accountability in exercise resolutions, by allowing users to quickly and reliably set up wallets to mediate such bets. 
Further applications can include public wallets which can be contributed to, letting public bets become viral pots and further incentivizing competitive exercise.

HaleCoin presents a new way of thinking about cryptocurrency. Beyond fiat valuation on the market, HaleCoin also serves as an indication of physical health, which poses interesting use cases. 
For instance, using HaleCoin for insurance payments not only benefits miners, but also insurance companies, as HaleCoin users are far more likely to exercise more and thus be more physically fit, and hence be less likely to need insurance payouts as well.

HaleCoin - making the world hale and healthy.
